During this assignment I asked ChatGPt what they thought of a cheese and meat platter, again. This time, it didn't pop up with any animation, but a front view of a cheese platter. I still don't understand, I never want to.

When doing my sketch, I wanted to use a top view to get the best view of the sketch just like a food photogragher would. This way you could see the shapes and the composition. Chatgpt only gives the minimum when it output the request.
