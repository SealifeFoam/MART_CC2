I honestly didn't think we'd go anywhere near ChatGpt in this class. 
The dish I choose was a meat and cheese platter. When put in the request to CG I was meant with what I honestly wasn't expecting. The result was/is a circle plate with two smaller circles animated with even smaller circles. Maybe perhaps it was because I had made a vague request but I thought it might give a little more. I also didn't expect it to add animation to the request. It feels like it narrowed competition and color from output.
